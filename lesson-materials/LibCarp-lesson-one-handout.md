# Library Carpentry Week One: Some Basics

_____
### Schedule

- Jargon Busting (1800-1845)
- Foundations (1845-1930)
- Regular Expressions (1930-2015)

_____
### Regular Expressions

- `[]` define a list or range of characters to be found
- `.` matches any character at all
- `\d` matches any single digit
- `\w` matches and part of word character (equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_] )
- `\s` matches any space, tab, or newline
- `\b` adds a word boundary
- `^` defines the start of the string
- `$` defines the end of the string
- `*` matches when the preceding character appears any number of times including zero
- `+` matches when the preceding character appears any number of times excluding zero
- `?` matches when the preceding character appears one or zero times
- `{VALUE}` matches the preceding character the number of times define by VALUE; ranges can be specified with the syntax `{VALUE,VALUE}`
- `|` simply means or

#### Exercise

What does `Fr[ea]nc[eh]` match?

What does `Fr[ea]nc[eh]$` match?

What would match strings that begin with `French` and `France` only?

How do you match the words `colour` and `color` (case insensitive)?

How would you find `headrest` and `head rest` but not `head  rest` (that is, with two spaces between `head` and `rest`?

How would you find a 4 letter word that ends a string and is preceded by at least one zero?

How do you match any 4 digit string?

How would you match the date format `dd-MM-yyyy`?

How would you match the date format `dd-MM-yyyy` or `dd-MM-yy` at the end of a string only?

How would you match publication formats such as `British Library : London, 2015` and `Manchester University Press : Manchester, 1999`?

### Next Week

#### Installation (to be completed before the session)

Windows users, see the section entitled 'Installing Git Bash' in the Programming Historian lesson [*Introduction to the Bash Command Line*](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash). OS X and Linux users, simply make sure you know how to find your 'Terminal'.

#### Where to go for help

Raise an issue on the Library Carpentry Week Two GitHub page https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/week-two-library-carpentry/issues (note: you'll need to sign-up to GitHub to do this. As you'll need a GitHub account for week three, there is value in doing this now)
