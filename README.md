## Library Carpentry. Introduction to Data.

This repository is for the Library Carpentry module Introduction to Data. It includes less plan, handouts, and indicative slides.

This repository is based on lesson materials first used on Library Carpentry week one, held 9 November 2015 at City University London. Slides used on the evening are here and for ease of use also on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/drjwbaker/library-carpentry-week-one-basics).

The first run of Library Carpentry was generously funded by the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/). The Software Sustainability Institute cultivates world-class research with software. The Institute is based at the universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Southampton and Oxford.
